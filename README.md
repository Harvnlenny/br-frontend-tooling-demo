This is a static, single page site for use in demoing code and process for the [Build Right: Frontend Tooling workshop](https://github.com/sparkbox/BR-Front-End-Tooling).

It's a fictional app called "Toolcase"â€”a simple list for developers and designers to showcase the tools they use for given tasks.
