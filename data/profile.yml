      I've used Sublime Text for most of my career as a frontend developer. It's blazing fast, extensible, and has a great community ecosystem.

      Like most designers, I cut my teeth on Photoshop and Illustrator. So naturally, when I moved from print to web design, I originally carried my Adobe habits along with me.

      That all changed when Sketch app came out. It's light-weight, it has web design on it's mind, and it's a joy to work with.

      I've taken the path from Microsoft Word (waaaay back), to Pages for Mac, to Google Docs, to a plain text / markdown editor. The trend in that brief history is definitely toward simplicity!

      In the "plain-text" writing category, I've tried several apps, but I've landing on Byword as the app where I do most of my writing that isn't code.
